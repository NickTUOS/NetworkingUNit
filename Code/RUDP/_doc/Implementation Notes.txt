- Optimize "Memory copy"

Implementation : MinRTO
-----------------------
I have test the min RTO but I have it slow down the transfer speed.

I have set MinRTO = 200 ms (like TCP XP), but it slow down implementation.
Even some Linux have MinRTO = 30 ms.

So, I have put MinRTO = 0 ms !!!

Implementation : SACK
---------------------
I have 4 ACK slots (range of ACK) in eack ACK.
Maybe I should have 2 or 3.

Implementation : PMTU Discovery
-------------------------------
It allow to discover the optimal MTU for our communication.
It is not aggressive, it send a probe message each "5 seconds"
